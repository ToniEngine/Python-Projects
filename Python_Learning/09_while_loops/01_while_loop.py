# A while loop is a strucute in python that allows us to loop through and execute a block of code multiple times
# while condition is True:
# Do something(Keep Looping inside the code)

i = 1
while i<=10:  # Is one less than or equals to 10? True, so pyhton loops through the code
    print(i)  # Prints the current value of i
    i = i +1  # Increments i by one snd goes back to the loop and checks the conditions again as long as it is True the loop continues and when loop is False, the loops ends and print the next line
print("Done with loop")
